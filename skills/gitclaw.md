# GitClaw

GitClaw is a custom integration that allows users to interact with Git repositories directly from OpenAI agents. It supports initializing repositories, staging files, committing with messages, pushing to remotes, and pulling changes. The skill is designed for easy use in conversational agents and can be invoked with common Git commands.
